# Fundamentals of Machine Learning – Experiments Repository

This repository contains a complete collection of experiments covering the **Fundamentals of Machine Learning**, progressing from basic regression to advanced neural and kernel-based methods.  
Each experiment is implemented using Python and demonstrated on the **Weather Prediction Dataset**, making the concepts practical and relatable.

---

## 📘 Overview

The main goal of this repository is to provide a structured, hands-on learning experience for understanding how various machine learning algorithms work — from linear regression to multilayer perceptrons and RBF networks.  
Every experiment includes step-by-step code, clear mathematical intuition, and result visualization using real-world **weather prediction data**.

## 🧠 Experiments Included

### Regression Models
- **Simple Linear Regression** – Predicting temperature or humidity using a single weather parameter.  
- **Multivariate Linear Regression** – Forecasting weather metrics using multiple atmospheric features.


### Clustering
- **K-Means Clustering** – Grouping weather patterns based on temperature, humidity, and pressure similarity.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Implemented for both **linear** and **non-linear (kernel)** classification tasks.

### Probabilistic Learning
- **Naïve Bayes Classifier** – Probabilistic approach for predicting categorical weather conditions.

### Decision Trees
- **Decision Tree Classifier** – Interpretable model for weather condition prediction.  
- **Pruning Techniques** – Reducing model complexity and preventing overfitting.

### Neural Networks
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** – Feedforward neural network for weather trend prediction.  
- **Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN)** – Kernel-based network for non-linear weather relationships.

### Kernel Methods
- **Kernel Functions** – Exploring polynomial and Gaussian (RBF) kernels for improved non-linear learning.
